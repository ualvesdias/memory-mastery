# Memory Mastery

Hello! This is a bot to help practice the PAO system, a technique for memorizing numbers.

/quiz will return a two-digit number. Then, you have to answer with the three items (Person, Action, Object) relative to the given number.

/learn <number> will return the three items for the provided number.

/mix will give you three two-digit numbers concatenated. You have to answer by providing the Person for the first two-digit number, the Action for the second two-digit number and the Object for the third two-digit number.

Finally, the answers must be given separated by commas: person,action,object
